# Using Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps variants for Network Intrusion Attack Detection. 


# Project Overview 
* Trained self-organizing maps with k nearest neighbor that detects network intrusion attacks from [NSL-KDD](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html) dataset.
* Feature selection using Feature Recursive Eliminator
* Optimized Self-Organizing Maps using Bayesian Optimization to reach the best model.
